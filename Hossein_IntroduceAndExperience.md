**Question 1: what is your major? / Tell me about your educational background?**
<br> **Answer** I have a bachelor's degree in software engineering.

**Question 2: Tell us about your work experiences?**
<br>**Answer** My profesion journey almost began at "Basamad" a telecommunications company, where I focused on telephone troubleshooting projects, telephone guides, and water and wastewater troubleshooting. I was responsible for software maintenance, support, deployment, and development. Those applications used widely across Iran. I worked with ASP.NET Web Forms and Windows Forms, N-layer architecture, SQL Server, Telerik and more. Stored Procedures extensively used in those projects, which allowed me to improve my skills in T-SQL, debugging stored procedures, and optimization. I spent over two years at Basamad.
<br><br>Seeking newer technologies and challenges, I embarked on learning Node.js and joined an IoT company called "Servin." At Servin, I contributed to two main projects: Indoor Positioning and Smart Farm.
<br><br>For the Indoor Positioning project, I developed a Node.js application that fetched event data and Caltech news from a web API at regular intervals and stored them in a relational manner in SQL Server using Sequelize. Additionally, I created a set of APIs for the indoor positioning software to retrieve the stored data.
<br><br>In the Smart Farm project, I worked on a web application that served as a showcase and user interface. It leveraged ASP.NET MVC and SQL Server for the database. The application received and stored data from sensors connected to livestock, equipment, and environmental sensors via RabbitMQ.
Dealing with a high volume of incoming data provided valuable experience for working with big data and optimizing RabbitMQ usage.
<br><br>After a year, I left Servin due to inadequate compensation, benefits, and limited guidance from highly experienced individuals in web software development. I then joined Milad Hospital, the largest hospital in Iran. At Milad Hospital, I participated in various projects, including triage, clinics, and the Hospital Information System (HIS). I was directly responsible for managing and implementing the electronic medical records project, which entailed storing scanned documents in a significant volume within the system. This experience allowed me to develop expertise in optimizing and partitioning data in SQL Server. Most of the projects at Milad Hospital involved Angular on the front end, so I learned Angular during this period. I also maintained a consulting collaboration with Servin during my tenure at the hospital.
<br><br>After over a year, I decided to leave the hospital and joined Karizma, a charismatic financial holding company. I was tasked with starting the Customer Club project from scratch and collaborated with a product manager. I utilized technologies such as ASP.NET Boilerplate, Hangfire, Mongo, Mongoose ODM, SQL Server, xUnit, DDD, Multi Tenancy, Audit Logging, and others. Eventually, additional team members joined, and I unofficially took on the role of team management, which further strengthened my leadership abilities. We successfully launched the project.
<br><br>Motivated by a promising job offer from Alibaba Iran, the largest travel services company in Iran, and considering the company's reputation in the .NET community, I joined Alibaba and worked in the B2C team. At Alibaba, I experienced a more professional working environment. I had the opportunity to gain expertise in a microservices project using Elastic Stk, Redis, Kubernetes, Prometheus, Grafana, Ocelot, and various other tools. Notable achievements at Alibaba include creating hotel pricing algorithms based on multiple parameters and migrating from NHibernate to Entity Framework. I also contributed to the "Safar Card" project, enabling organizations and individuals to purchase gift cards with specified credits. Additionally, I collaborated with colleagues from other organizations on various Alibaba projects.
<br><br>Currently, due to the economic, political, and security conditions in Iran, I have made the decision to migrate and seek new opportunities.
